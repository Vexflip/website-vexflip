## <span class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-800">Hello! I am Sylvain ðŸ˜„</span>
I'm a solo developer passionate about creating fast, reliable, and beautiful websites.

With a background in technology and a strong focus on user experience, I help individuals and small businesses bring their ideas to life on the web. Every project I take on is treated with care, attention to detail, and a personal commitment to quality.

I handle everything from planning and design to development and long-term maintenance. My goal is to deliver not just a website, but a platform that helps you succeed. I am looking forward to working together :D
