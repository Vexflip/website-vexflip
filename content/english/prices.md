faq:
  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  items:
    - question: "Who are your websites for?"
      answer: "I build fast, secure Hugo websites for individuals, startups, small businesses, and growing companies that want performance without bloated code or expensive maintenance."

    - question: "Do you provide hosting?"
      answer: "Yes. I offer optional hosting for €39/month (check the Website Maintenance Plans), which includes SSL, fast global delivery (via CDN), and continuous deployment from Git."

    - question: "What if I need more pages later?"
      answer: "No problem. My maintenance plans include content updates, and I offer add-on services to expand your site as your needs grow."

    - question: "What’s included in the SEO setup?"
      answer: "I include metadata, performance optimization, clean URLs, and structured HTML. On the Professional and Growth tiers, I also perform monthly SEO health checks."

    - question: "Do I need a CMS?"
      answer: "Not necessarily. Hugo is great for static sites without a database. But if you prefer editing content yourself, I offer optional CMS integration (+€29/month) using DecapCMS or similar."

    - question: "What analytics do you offer?"
      answer: "I use lightweight, privacy-friendly tools like Plausible, Umami or Google Analytics. These are GDPR-compliant and give you clear visitor insights without invasive tracking."

    - question: "What does 'Custom Project' mean?"
      answer: "If you need something unique—multilingual support, form integrations, client portals, or custom features—I’ll scope the project with you and build exactly what you need."

    - question: "Can I cancel anytime?"
      answer: "Yes. Maintenance plans are monthly and can be canceled with a 7-day notice. Website builds are one-time unless we agree on a retainer."
