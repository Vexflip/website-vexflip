faq:
  items:
  - answer: I build fast, secure Hugo websites for individuals, startups, small businesses,
      and growing companies that want performance without bloated code or expensive
      maintenance.
    question: Who are your websites for?
  - answer: Yes. I offer optional hosting for €39/month (check the Website Maintenance
      Plans), which includes SSL, fast global delivery (via CDN), and continuous deployment
      from Git.
    question: Do you provide hosting?
  - answer: No problem. My maintenance plans include content updates, and I offer
      add-on services to expand your site as your needs grow.
    question: What if I need more pages later?
  - answer: I include metadata, performance optimization, clean URLs, and structured
      HTML. On the Professional and Growth tiers, I also perform monthly SEO health
      checks.
    question: What’s included in the SEO setup?
  - answer: Not necessarily. Hugo is great for static sites without a database. But
      if you prefer editing content yourself, I offer optional CMS integration (+€29/month)
      using DecapCMS or similar.
    question: Do I need a CMS?
  - answer: I use lightweight, privacy-friendly tools like Plausible, Umami or Google
      Anlaytics. These are GDPR-compliant and give you clear visitor insights without
      invasive tracking.
    question: What analytics do you offer?
  - answer: If you need something unique—multilingual support, form integrations,
      client portals, or custom features—I’ll scope the project with you and build
      exactly what you need.
    question: What does 'Custom Project' mean?
  - answer: Yes. Maintenance plans are monthly and can be canceled with a 7-day notice.
      Website builds are one-time unless we agree on a retainer.
    question: Can I cancel anytime?
